      "_content" : "Born in Lancashire, England. I lived for a short time in Ontario, Canada before returning to England where I spent 11 years living between London and the South coast before moving to Houston, Texas. Now retired after working for 20 years for a major medical institution. I love to photograph people in everyday situations. As I now work with animal rehab (both domestic and wildlife) I take advantage of the photo ops that this presents. Basically, I photograph to remember -  to capture a moment in time. "
