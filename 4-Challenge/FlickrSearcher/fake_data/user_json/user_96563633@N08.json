      "_content" : "Digital artist trained as an illustrator with an itch for photography.  I wanted to start taking my photography hobby seriously in '06 and bought my first &quot;big girl&quot; camera, a Canon 30D, and felt like I was seeing the world anew.\n\nI love photographing animals, particularly horses, and nature.  I briefly worked at the Kentucky Horse Park and have returned many times since then as it's my only access to horses and a great place for photos.\n\nI currently have eight furry cat models that are often my test subjects when trying out different camera settings.\n\nRecently my 30D suffered some tech issues and I decided to go with a new camera system instead of having it repaired.  I'm now out and about with a Sony Alpha a99.  It's like going from an old car to learning the controls of a spaceship...\n\nI also love tea and vegetarian food. :-D"
